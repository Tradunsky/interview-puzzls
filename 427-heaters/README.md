475. Heaters
In this problem, we're given two arrays: houses and heaters. 
Each element in the houses array represents the position of a house on a horizontal line, 
and each element in the heaters array represents the position of a heater on the same line. 
Our objective is to find the minimum radius required for all the heaters so that every house can be covered by at least one heater's warm radius. 
Keep in mind that all heaters are set to the same radius, and we must choose it so every house is within the radius of at least one heater.

The goal is to minimize this radius while still ensuring that every house is within the warm range of at least one heater.
