979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree
You are provided with the root of a binary tree, where each node contains a certain number of coins (node.val). 
The total number of coins in the tree is equal to the total number of nodes (n). 
Your task is to redistribute the coins so that every node has exactly one coin. 
Redistribution is done by moving coins between adjacent nodes (where adjacency is defined by the parent-child relationship). 
On each move, you can take one coin from a node and move it to an adjacent node. 
This problem asks you to find the minimum number of moves required to achieve a state where every node has exactly one coin.
