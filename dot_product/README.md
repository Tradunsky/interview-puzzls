Design a data structure to compute dot_product, do not use numpy.

For example, given two vectors
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = [6,7,8,9,0]

dot_product(a, b) == a1*b1 + a2*b2 + ... an*bn == 6+14+24+36+0 == 80

After you implement one, consider changing it to take into account spare vectors and come up with the algorithm 
of time complexity better than quadratic.
